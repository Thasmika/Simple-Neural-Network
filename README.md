ðŸ§  Built a Neural Network from Scratch

In this project, I implemented a fully functional neural network from the ground up using Python â€” without relying on high-level deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The goal was to deeply understand and demystify the internal mechanics of neural networks by coding every step manually.

ðŸš€ Key Features
Implemented forward propagation and backpropagation algorithms manually

Explored various activation functions and their impact on learning

Designed custom loss functions to measure model performance

Trained the network on a sample dataset to demonstrate learning capabilities

Added modular and clean code structure for easy extension and experimentation

ðŸ§© What I Learned
âœ… Deep dive into how neural networks learn through gradient descent
âœ… The importance of activation functions and initialization
âœ… Practical challenges like overfitting, learning rate tuning, and convergence
âœ… Writing clean, modular Python code for machine learning projects

ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used
Python

NumPy

Matplotlib (for visualizing training progress)

ðŸ“Š Future Improvements
Extend to support multiple hidden layers and different architectures

Add support for common optimizers like Adam or RMSprop

Experiment with real-world datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10)

Build a simple web interface to visualize predictions

ðŸ’¡ Why this matters:
Building a neural network from scratch helped me gain an intuitive, practical understanding of deep learning fundamentals â€” beyond just using libraries. This knowledge makes me a better ML practitioner and developer.
